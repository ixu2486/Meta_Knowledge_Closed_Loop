# 🧠 svm_core

**Semantic Virtual Memory Engine — Powered by OpenCL 2.0 SVM**

This repository provides an experimental, yet fully functional SVM memory orchestration engine using:
- Fine-Grain Shared Virtual Memory (Zero-Copy)
- `enqueue_svm_map` / `enqueue_svm_unmap` flows
- Bypassed `clSetKernelArg` logic for true shared pointer access
- AMD RX 5700 tested (gfx1010:xnack-)
